- Maintain pnpm workspace integrity and TypeScript strictness.
- Respect existing import paths; avoid mass rewrite of relative/alias imports.
- Preserve Tailwind utility ordering and shadcn component structure.
- Do not introduce alternative routers/state/form libs; extend TanStack/Zustand/react-hook-form.
- Uphold Stytch auth assumptions: rely on HTTP-only cookies; never surface secrets in client code.
- Keep DB access within repository/helpers; avoid inline engine/session in route handlers.
