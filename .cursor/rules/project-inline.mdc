- Maintain pnpm workspace integrity and TypeScript strictness.
- Keep imports absolute via configured aliases (`@`, `@saas-template/shared`); avoid noisy relative path rewrites.
- Preserve Tailwind utility orderings and shadcn component structure.
- Do not add alternative state managers, routers, or form libraries—extend existing TanStack/Zustand/RHF patterns.
- Uphold Stytch auth assumptions: rely on HTTP-only cookies and bearer tokens; never surface secrets.
- When editing shared code, ensure Zod ↔ Pydantic schemas remain in sync.
