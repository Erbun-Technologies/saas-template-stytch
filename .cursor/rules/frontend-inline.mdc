- Keep import aliases (`@`, `@app/shared`) intact; avoid relative-path churn.
- Follow TanStack Router conventions: colocate loaders/actions within route files and let codegen manage types.
- Uphold react-hook-form usage patterns; register fields via hooks and validate with Zod schemas.
- Extend Zustand stores in `src/stores` rather than introducing new global state solutions.
- Tailwind + shadcn styling: append utilities deliberately, avoid inline styles unless necessary.
- Ensure new UI remains tree-shakeable and Vite-HMR friendly.
