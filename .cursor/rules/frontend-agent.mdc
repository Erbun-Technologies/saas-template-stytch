# Frontend Scope
- Limit changes to `apps/web`; coordinate shared types via `packages/shared` if needed.
- Preserve TanStack file-based routing; add pages under `src/routes` then regenerate routes with `pnpm --filter web run generate:routes`.
- SPA-only: Vite dev server on 5173; no SSR/RSC.

# Implementation Guardrails
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching, Zustand for state, react-hook-form for forms (with Zod when needed).
- Auth: integrate via `src/lib/stytch.ts`; do not expose secrets or manually handle tokens; rely on HTTP-only cookies.
- UI: Tailwind + shadcn, lucide-react icons; keep class ordering and component patterns.
- API base URL comes from `VITE_API_URL`; use `API_BASE_URL` from `src/lib/config`.
- Do not edit `routeTree.gen.ts`; it is generated.

# Quality & Tooling
- Keep TypeScript strict; resolve type errors with feature work.
- Use `pnpm --filter web` scripts for type-check/build; avoid ad-hoc toolchains.
- Prefer local stubs over live service calls in examples/tests.
